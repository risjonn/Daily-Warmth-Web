**Project Purpose**

A responsive, cute, emotionally supportive website for my girlfriend.

She can open it daily to receive:

- A **Message of the Day**
- Extra uplifting messages
- A special **comfort mode** when she’s feeling down

The site uses a **green + pink pastel theme**, with cute **cat / fox / capybara illustrations**.
