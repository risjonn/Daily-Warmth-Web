    "Hey baeburs, whatever you're feeling right now is completely okay. Sadness, anxiety, fear, overwhelm, all of it is valid. You don't have to justify or explain your feelings to anyone, including me. I'm just here, accepting you fully as you are.",

    "Naeburs, I love you on your good days when you're laughing and everything feels manageable. But I also love you on your hard days when you're struggling and everything feels too much. My love doesn't change based on how you're doing, it's constant, always. 💚",
    "Cinta, I need you to hear this: you are not a burden. You never were, and you never will be. Your struggles don't make you difficult or too much. They make you human. And I love every part of you, including the parts you think are hard to love.",
    "BB, it's okay to not be okay right now. You don't have to put on a brave face or pretend everything is fine. Not with me. You can fall apart if you need to, I'll help you pick up the pieces. That's what love is. 💚",
    "Princess, I'm sending you all my love and warmth right now. Imagine me wrapping my arms around you, holding you close, telling you that everything is going to be alright. Because it will be. We'll get through this together, one moment at a time. 🤗",
    "Hey baeburs, you are so much stronger than you realize. The fact that you're still here, still trying, still breathing despite everything you've been through, that's extraordinary. You're extraordinary. Never forget that.",

    "Cinta, you matter to me more than you know. Your life has meaning and purpose, even on days when you can't see it. The world is better with you in it. I'm better with you in it. Please don't forget how important you are.",
    "BB, I'm so proud of you for getting through this moment, this hour, this day. I know it's been hard. I know you're tired. But you did it. You're still here, and that takes incredible courage. I see you, and I'm proud of you. 💚",
    "Princess, you are worthy of love, rest, peace, and every good thing this world has to offer. You don't have to earn these things, you deserve them simply because you exist. You are enough, exactly as you are right now.",
    "Hey naeburs, remember that storms don't last forever. The rain will stop. The clouds will part. The sun will shine again. And when it does, I'll be right here with you, holding your hand through it all. Better days are coming, I promise. ☀️",
    "Cinta, your mental health struggles don't make you broken or damaged. They make you human. And you're handling them with so much grace and courage. I'm in awe of your strength, even when you don't feel strong. 💚",
    "BB, when your mind is telling you lies, that you're not good enough, not worthy, not lovable, please remember this truth: sayang loves you completely. Every part of you. Always. Those negative thoughts aren't facts, they're just thoughts, and they will pass.",
    "Baeburs, if you're reading this during a panic attack or anxiety spiral, I want you to focus on my words. You are safe. This will pass. Your body is trying to protect you, but you're not in danger. Breathe with me. In... and out. I'm here with you. 💚",
    "Princess, please don't give up on yourself, even when everything feels hopeless. You've come so far already. You've overcome so much. You have more strength in you than you realize. I believe in you, even when you can't believe in yourself.",
    "Hey cinta, on days when existing feels like too much effort, please know that your presence alone is enough. You don't have to accomplish anything. You don't have to be productive. Just being here, breathing, that's enough. You are enough. 💚",
    "Naeburs, I know the depression makes everything feel gray and heavy and pointless. But I promise you, there's still color in this world, still beauty, still reasons to hold on. And I'll help you find them again, one small moment at a time.",
    "BB, you're allowed to feel scared, anxious, overwhelmed. Those feelings are valid and real. But please don't let them convince you that you're alone, because you're not. Sayang is here, and I'm not going anywhere. We'll face this together. 💚",
    "Princess, recovery isn't linear. Some days you'll feel better, some days you'll feel worse. That's normal and okay. Setbacks don't erase your progress. You're still moving forward, even when it doesn't feel like it. I'm proud of you for trying. ✨",
    "Hey baeburs, I wish I could take away your pain, carry your burdens, fight your battles for you. Since I can't, I'll do the next best thing, I'll stand beside you through all of it. You don't have to face this alone. I'm here, always. 💚",
    "Cinta, your life has value and meaning, even on days when depression tells you otherwise. You matter to me. You matter to this world. And I need you here. Please keep holding on, for me, for yourself, for all the beautiful moments still waiting for you.",
    "Naeburs, it's okay to cry. Tears aren't weakness, they're release. Let yourself feel what you need to feel. I'm here to hold space for all of your emotions, the comfortable ones and the painful ones. You're safe to feel everything with me. 💚",
    "BB, I know it's hard to see right now, but this moment is temporary. You won't feel this way forever. You've gotten through hard times before, and you'll get through this too. And I'll be right here beside you every step of the way.",
    "Princess, please be patient with yourself. Healing takes time. Growing takes time. Recovering takes time. There's no rush. Move at your own pace, and know that sayang will be here supporting you through every single step of your journey. 💚",
    "Hey cinta, you're doing so much better than you think you are. I know you can't see your own progress, but I can. You're growing, learning, surviving. And that's incredible. I'm so proud of the person you're becoming, even through all this pain.",
    "Naeburs, on your hardest days when you can't see any light, please borrow my hope. I have enough hope for both of us. I believe in your healing, in your strength, in your future, even when you can't. Let me believe for you until you can believe for yourself. 💚",
    "BB, you are loved. Deeply, completely, unconditionally. Not because of what you do or accomplish, but because of who you are. And who you are is more than enough. You will always be enough for me. Always. 💚",
    "Princess, I know the world feels overwhelming right now. Everything feels like too much. But you don't have to handle it all at once. Just focus on this moment. This breath. This heartbeat. That's all you need to do right now. One moment at a time, bb.",
    "Hey baeburs, sayang wants you to know that you're not fighting this battle alone. When you're too tired to fight, I'll fight for you. When you can't see the way forward, I'll guide you. When you want to give up, I'll give you reasons to hold on. Together, we've got this. 💚",
    "Cinta, your depression doesn't define you. It's something you're experiencing, not something you are. You're still the beautiful, kind, amazing person I fell in love with. This darkness is temporary, your light is permanent. I see it even when you can't. ✨",
    "Naeburs, please don't apologize for struggling, for having bad days, for needing support. You have nothing to be sorry for. Mental health challenges aren't your fault. I'm here because I want to be, because I love you, because you matter to me. Always. 💚",
    "BB, I promise you that better days are ahead. Days when you'll feel lighter, when breathing won't feel so hard, when existing won't feel like such a burden. Those days are coming, cinta. Please hold on for them. Hold on for me. Hold on for yourself. 💚",
    "Princess, when the darkness feels suffocating and you can't see any way out, remember this: you've survived every single difficult day so far. That's 100% survival rate. You're a warrior, bb. And this time will be no different. You'll make it through. I believe in you. ✨",
    "Hey naeburs, I love you. Today, tomorrow, always. Through the good times and the hard times. Through your best days and your worst days. Through everything. My love for you is unwavering, unchanging, unconditional. You are safe in my heart, forever. 💚"
